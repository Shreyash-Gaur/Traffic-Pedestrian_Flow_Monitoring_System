# Advanced Counting Solutions with YOLO and SORT üöóüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### **Real-Time Vehicle and People Counting with Cutting-Edge Technology**

Welcome to a dual-project showcase where cutting-edge object detection and tracking technologies are harnessed to count vehicles and people in real-time video feeds. This project suite demonstrates the application of YOLO (You Only Look Once) models and the SORT tracking algorithm to solve real-world counting challenges with precision and efficiency.

## üåü **Project Highlights**

### **1. Car Counting Using YOLO and SORT**

- **Real-Time Vehicle Detection**: Leverage the power of YOLOv10 to detect and classify vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes.
- **Efficient Vehicle Tracking**: Implement SORT to track vehicles across frames, ensuring accurate counting by maintaining a unique ID for each vehicle.
- **Dynamic Counting**: A predefined line serves as the counting threshold, updating the vehicle count as each vehicle crosses the line.
- **Visual Appeal**: The project offers an intuitive and visually engaging representation of the counting process, with live updates on the video feed.

### **2. People Counting Using YOLO and SORT**

- **Accurate People Detection**: Utilize YOLOv8 to detect individuals in crowded or dynamic environments, focusing on the "person" class.
- **Robust Tracking Mechanism**: Apply SORT to track people as they move through the video, maintaining accurate counts by preventing duplicate counting.
- **Dual Direction Counting**: The project features two counting thresholds, allowing for bidirectional counting‚Äîtracking people moving both up and down.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: The live video feed displays bounding boxes, tracking lines, and dynamic counts, offering immediate visual feedback.

## üîç **How It Works**

### **Car Counting**

1. **Detection**: YOLOv10 scans each video frame, identifying vehicles with high accuracy.
2. **Tracking**: The SORT algorithm tracks the detected vehicles, ensuring each is counted only once as it crosses a predefined line.
3. **Counting**: Vehicles crossing the counting line are tallied, with the count displayed on the screen in real time.

### **People Counting**

1. **Detection**: YOLOv8 is employed to detect people in the video feed.
2. **Tracking**: SORT keeps track of each person, using unique IDs to prevent multiple counts.
3. **Dual Counting**: The project counts people moving in both directions across two separate lines, displaying the counts on the screen.

## üöÄ **Why These Projects Stand Out**

- **State-of-the-Art Technology**: These projects combine the latest in object detection (YOLO) and tracking (SORT) for robust, real-time solutions.
- **Versatility**: Adaptable to various environments, from traffic management to pedestrian monitoring in urban areas.
- **Visual Engagement**: Both projects feature clear and engaging visual outputs, making them suitable for real-world applications where clarity and precision are key.

## üéì **Learning Outcomes**

- **Advanced Computer Vision**: Understand the integration of YOLO for detection and SORT for tracking to create sophisticated counting systems.
- **Real-World Impact**: Explore how AI can be applied to improve infrastructure management, traffic monitoring, and crowd control.
- **Technical Mastery**: Gain insights into tuning detection and tracking parameters for specific applications, enhancing both accuracy and performance.

## üìà **Future Enhancements**

- **Expanded Object Detection**: Extend the projects to detect and count additional objects or classes, depending on the application's needs.
- **Analytics Integration**: Incorporate data analytics to provide deeper insights into traffic or pedestrian patterns.
- **Multi-Line Counting**: Introduce additional counting lines or regions for more complex environments.
